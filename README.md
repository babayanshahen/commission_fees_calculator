Task
====

## Situation
Paysera users can go to a branch to cash in and/or cash out from Paysera account. There are also commission fees for both cash in and cash out. Only supported currency is EUR.

## Commission Fees

### For Cash In
Commission fee - 0.03% from total amount, but no more than 5.00 EUR.

You can get configuration from [API](https://developers.paysera.com/tasks/api/cash-in)

### For Cash Out
There are different commission fees for cash out for natural and legal persons.

#### Natural Persons
Default commission fee - 0.3% from cash out amount.

1000.00 EUR per week (from monday to sunday) is free of charge.

If total cash out amount is exceeded - commission is calculated only from exceeded amount (that is, for 1000.00 EUR there is still no commission fee).

You can get configuration from [API](https://developers.paysera.com/tasks/api/cash-out-natural)

#### Legal persons
Commission fee - 0.3% from amount, but not less than 0.50 EUR for operation.

You can get configuration from [API](https://developers.paysera.com/tasks/api/cash-out-juridical)

### Rounding
After calculating commission fee, it's rounded to the smallest currency item (for example, for EUR currency - cents) to upper bound (ceiled). For example, 0.023 EUR should be rounded to 3 Euro cents.

## Input data
Input data is given in JSON file. Performed operations are given in that file. In each object following data is provided:
```js
{
    "date": "2016-01-05", // operation date in format `Y-m-d`
    "user_id": 1, // user id, integer
    "user_type": "natural", // user type, one of “natural”(natural person) or “juridical”(legal person)
    "type": "cash_in", // operation type, one of “cash_in” or “cash_out”
    "operation": {
        "amount": 200, // operation amount(for example `2.12` or `3`)
        "currency": "EUR" // operation currency `EUR`
    }
}
```
All operations are ordered by their date ascendingly.

## Expected Result
As a single argument program must accept a path to the input file.

Program must output result to stdout.

Result - calculated commission fees for each operation. In each line only final calculated commission fee must be provided without currency.

Evaluation Criteria
===================
* all requirements must be met;
* code quality - it's maintainability, extensibility, testability; speed of the system can also be considered, but is not as important as other criteria.

Task Submission
===============
Before submitting your task, please review the requirements once again – **all of them must be accomplished**.

You can upload the source (i.e. to GitHub) publicly, but **please refrain from using Paysera name** in title, description or source code.

Submit the task in your chosen format (link to versioned code in GitHub/Google Drive or code in zip file, etc.) by sending it to the email provided by Paysera HR Coordinator or your Agency. Please also include approx. how much time was spent to complete the task.
